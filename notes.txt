Leaf: Green>red>blue
	shadowed leaf: all values below 60
	leaf in sun: green-red > 15, green - blue > 30
Dirt: generally is red>blue>green

-Tried using stats difference of means of every 9x9 pixels square to determine if square is leaf or dirt
-failed, got 91-95% leaf composition 
-tried a simple if green-red > 25 and green-blue > 40 then is leaf, else its dirt
-worked well
-still no way to verify

auto threshold
Remove specks of white that aren't leaves:
	invert image
	wand picker on black leaves 
	invert selection to select everything else 
	cut out selected
	invert selected back to white
	invert image again
histogram
divide number of white pixels by total count, (hover over the right most bar)



ImageJ: Fiji
	ctrl-L - gives all commands and locations of features
	plugins->macros->record ****** - records all actions and can export into python/java code

image segmentation - segments image into sections, like separating leaves from soil

thresholding - separates image based on color, using a threshold limit of color difference

color images:
	best: convert to grayscale
	compare histograms, soil: no change, leaf: noticable changes even in shadowed leaves

possible standards:
	motion tracking gray sphere
	gray color card in picture
	soil sampling
	leaf sampling
	blackwhite calibration checker board on ground
	gps-data
	temperature

edge detector: start at low threshold, loop increasing threshold until number of edges reach x
math model: input edge from image, output how close it is

SIFT - scale image feature transform 

watering soil changes soil color

find out what they do, expect, keep going back to them

USE Git/source control

write down design before coding
